## Bloor, Richard
- ### _Tangerine_
	- "Paul Fisher sees the world from behind glasses so thick he looks like a bug-eyed alien. But he’s not so blind that he can’t see there are some very unusual things about his family’s new home in Tangerine County, Florida. Where else does a sinkhole swallow the local school, fire burn underground for years, and lightning strike at the same time every day?"

## Borges, Jorge Luis
- ### _Funes the Memorius_
	- "'Funes the Memorious' is the tale of one Ireneo Funes, who, after falling off his horse and receiving a bad head injury, acquired the amazing talent — or curse — of remembering absolutely everything."
- ### _The Library of Babel_
	- "A short story by Argentine author conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set."

## Chabon, Michael

## Dostoevsky, Fyodor
- ### _The Double_
	- "The Double centers on a government clerk who goes mad. It deals with the internal psychological struggle of its main character, Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, who repeatedly encounters someone who is his exact double in appearance but confident, aggressive, and extroverted, characteristics that are the polar opposites to those of the toadying 'pushover' protagonist."

## Clover, Carol J.
- ### _Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film_
	- "Do the pleasures of horror movies really begin and end in sadism? So the public discussion of film assumes, and so film theory claims. Carol Clover argues, however, that these films work mainly to engage the viewer in the plight of the victim-hero, who suffers fright but rises to vanquish the forces of oppression."

## Cringely, Robert X.
- ### _Accidental Empires_
	- "Computer manufacturing is--after cars, energy production and illegal drugs--the largest industry in the world, and it's one of the last great success stories in American business. Accidental Empires is the trenchant, vastly readable history of that industry, focusing as much on the astoundingly odd personalities at its core--Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mitch Kapor, etc. and the hacker culture they spawned as it does on the remarkable technology they created."

## Demick, Barbara
- ### _Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea_
	- "Award-winning journalist Barbara Demick follows the lives of six North Korean citizens over fifteen years—a chaotic period that saw the death of Kim Il-sung, the rise to power of his son Kim Jong-il, and a devastating famine that killed one-fifth of the population."

	

## Dick, Philip K.
- ### _Ubik_
	- "Chip works for Glen Runciter's anti-psi security agency, which hires out its talents to block telepathic snooping and paranormal dirty tricks. When its special team tackles a big job on the Moon, something goes terribly wrong. Runciter is killed, it seems--but messages from him now appear on toilet walls, traffic tickets, or product labels. Meanwhile, fragments of reality are timeslipping into past versions: Joe Chip's beloved stereo system reverts to a hand-cranked 78 player with bamboo needles. Why does Runciter's face appear on U.S. coins? Why the repeated ads for a hard-to-find universal panacea called Ubik ('safe when taken as directed')?"

## Didion, Joan
- ### _Slouching Towards Bethlehem_
	- "A collection of essays about the authors' experiences in California in the 1960s. The title essay describes Didion's impressions of the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco during the neighborhood's heyday as a countercultural center. In contrast to the more utopian image of the milieu promoted by counterculture sympathizers then and now, Didion offered a rather grim portrayal of the goings-on, including an encounter with a pre-school-age child who was given LSD by her parents."

## Eggers, Dave
- ### _What is the What_
	- "a 2006 novel based on the real life story of Valentino Achak Deng, a Sudanese refugee and member of the Lost Boys of Sudan program."

- ### _You Shall Know Our Velocity_
	- "The plot follows Will and Hand, two childhood friends who set out on a week-long, around-the-world odyssey, ostensibly to give away a large sum of money."

## Greene, Graham
- ### _The Power and the Glory_
	- "The novel tells the story of an outlaw Roman Catholic priest in the Mexican state of Tabasco during the 1930s, when the Mexican government was trying to suppress the Catholic Church."

## Hitchens, Christopher
- ### _Letters to a Young Contrarian_
	- "the book is addressed directly to the reader—'My Dear X' —as a series of missives exploring a range of 'contrarian,' radical, independent or "dissident" positions, and advocating the attitudes best suited to cultivating and to holding them. Hitchens touches on his own ideological development, the nature of debate and humour, the ways in which language is slyly manipulated in apology for offensive and ridiculous positions, and how to see through this and recognise it whenever it arises in oneself."

## Ishiguro, Kazuo
- ### _Never let me go_
	- "Never Let Me Go is a 2005 dystopian science fiction novel by Japanese-born British author Kazuo Ishiguro."

## Joyce, James
- ### _Finnegan's Wake_
	- "Finnegans Wake is a novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It is significant for its experimental style and reputation as one of the most difficult works of fiction in the English language. Written in Paris over a period of seventeen years, and published in 1939, two years before the author's death, Finnegans Wake was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which many critics believe were attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams."

- ## Kabat-Zinn, Jon
- ### _Wherever You Go, There You Are_
	- "In his follow-up to Full Catastrophe Living--a book in which he presented basic meditation techniques as a way of reducing stress and healing from illness--here Jon Kabat-Zinn goes much more deeply into the practice of meditation for its own sake."

- ## Kang, Chol-hwan
- ### _The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag_
	- "North Korea is today one of the last bastions of hard-line Communism. Its leaders have kept a tight grasp on their one-party regime, quashing any nascent opposition movements and sending all suspected dissidents to its brutal concentration camps for "re-education." Kang Chol-hwan is the first survivor of one of these camps to escape and tell his story to the world."


## Kosinski, Jerry
- ### _The Painted Bird_
	- "The Painted Bird is a controversial 1965 novel by Jerzy Kosiński which describes the world as seen by a young boy, 'considered a Gypsy or Jewish stray,' who wanders about small towns scattered around Eastern Europe during World War II."

## Lethem, Jonathan
- ### _The Fortress of Solitude_
	- "The Fortress of Solitude is a 2003 semi-autobiographical novel by Jonathan Lethem set in Brooklyn and spanning the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. It follows two teenage friends, Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude, one white and one black, who discover a magic ring. The novel explores the issues of race and culture, gentrification, self-discovery, and music."

## Martin, Bradley K.
- ### _Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader_
	- "Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader offers in-depth portraits of North Korea's two ruthless and bizarrely Orwellian leaders, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il. Lifting North Korea's curtain of self-imposed isolation, this book will take readers inside a society, that to a Westerner, will appear to be from another planet. Subsisting on a diet short on food grains and long on lies, North Koreans have been indoctrinated from birth to follow unquestioningly a father-son team of megalomaniacs."

## Murakami, Haruki
- ### _Norwegian Wood_
	- "A nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo.[3] Through Watanabe's reminiscences we see him develop relationships with two very different women — the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori."

## Nabokov, Vladimir 
- ### _Pale Fire_
	- "The novel is presented as a 999-line poem titled 'Pale Fire', written by the fictional John Shade, with a foreword and lengthy commentary by a neighbor and academic colleague of the poet, Charles Kinbote. Together these elements form a narrative in which both authors are central characters."

## Keyes, Daniel
- ### _Flowers for Algernon_
	- "The eponymous Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence by artificial means. The story is told by a series of progress reports written by Charlie Gordon, the first human test subject for the surgery, and it touches upon many different ethical and moral themes such as the treatment of the mentally disabled."

## McCarthy, Cormac
- ### _Blood Meridian_
	- "The majority of the narrative follows a teenager referred to only as "the kid," with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred Native Americans and others in the United States–Mexico borderlands from 1849 to 1850 for bounty, pleasure, and eventually out of sheer compulsion. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by Judge Holden, a huge, intellectual man depicted as bald from head to toe and philosophically emblematic of the eternal and all-encompassing nature of war."

## Ondaatje, Michael
- ### _Coming Through Slaughter_
	- "The novel is a fictionalised version of the life of the New Orleans jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden. It covers the last months of Bolden's sanity in 1907, as his music becomes more radical and his behaviour more erratic. "

## Parish, James R. 
- ### _Fiasco: A history of Hollywood's Iconic Flops_
	- "A film hit or miss often forms two sides of the same coin, notes veteran entertainment observer Parish (The Hollywood Book of Scandals) in this gleefully readable, well-researched study of hubris in Hollywood. Parish's 15 choice box-office busts since 1963's Cleopatra demonstrate how 'the combination of ill-matched personalities and tangled situations can result in chaos during the making of a must-succeed, extremely costly Hollywood feature.'"

## Ronson, John
- ### _The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry_ 
	- "They say one out of every hundred people is a psychopath. You probably passed one on the street today. These are people who have no empathy, who are manipulative, deceitful, charming, seductive, and delusional. The Psychopath Test is the New York Times bestselling exploration of their world and the madness industry."

## Schreber, Daniel P. 
- ### _Memoirs of my nervous illness_
	- "Autobiographical memoir written by a German judge who suffered from a disorder then known as 'dementia praecox', later recognized to be schizophrenia.  The memoirs discuss frankly from a first-person perspective Schrebers' descent into madness."

## Stein, Gertrude
- ### _The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas_
	- "A book written in the guise of an autobiography, written by the authors' life partner. One of the first and most recognizble LGBT literary pioneers."

## Updike, John
- ### _Rabbit, Run_
	- "The novel depicts three months in the life of a 26-year-old former high school basketball player named Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom, and his attempts to escape the constraints of his life."

## Wright, Lawrence
- ### _Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief_
	- "In efficient, unemotional prose, Wright begins with the biography of founder L. Ron Hubbard: his days as a prodigiously prolific writer of pulp fiction, his odd military career, the publication of his breakthrough self-help book Dianetics (1950), and the influence, riches, and controversy that have followed since he founded the Church of Scientology in 1954. For those aware of Scientology through its celebrity adherents (Tom Cruise and John Travolta are the best known) rather than its works, the sheer scope of the church’s influence and activities will prove jaw-dropping."
