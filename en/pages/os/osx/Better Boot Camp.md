# Better Boot Camp integration

## A few third party tools for improving Windows on a Mac

- [Macs Fan Control](http://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control "Macs Fan Control") - Allows you to automatically adjust fan speed in relation to temperature sensor
- [Power Plan Assistant](http://www.powerplan7.com/home.htm "Power Plan Assistant") - Helps with crappy Windows battery life.  Nagware, but free.  Prereq for trackpad drivers.
- [Trackpad++](http://trackpad.powerplan7.com/ "Trackpad++") - Configures gestures and other fanciness, better than built in BootCamp drivers. Also nagware.
- [SharpKeys](https://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/ "SharpKeys") - Remap keyboard layout. 
	+ Left CTRL to Left Windows (enables Mac like shortcuts)
	+ Left Windows to Left CTRL (to remap CTRL key)

- For some reason you need to set the sound as *Quadrophonic* , in the `Sound` control panel.
	+ Extra EQ and sound adjustment can be done via [Equalizer APO](http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/ "Equalizer APO")
