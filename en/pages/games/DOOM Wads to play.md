## Better Vanilla Doom

	- PK's Smooth weapons: modified so that the pistol/shotgun/chaingun have vertical spread too (proportional to the SSG). This does reduce their effectiveness as sniping weapons, but also gets rid of the completely straight bullet-holes the normal weapons leave behind.
	- PK's upgraded SFX
	- Doom Expanded HUD: made to work with the modified weapons. Very clean HUD but worth it for the 'berserker' status icon alone.
	- Pistol Start: made to work with the modified pistol
	- Alternative Palette: De-saturates the greens and blues and makes it a bit 'warmer' and a lot less ugly IMO
	- Bloodfix: Isn't it annoying how cacodemons bleed red? This is made to match the alternative palette.
	- Smart Scavenger: Walk over a box of bullets when you have 399 and instead of swallowing the whole thing it cascades into clips.
	- Sprite Fix (SPRFIX13.WAD Doom 2 only): Properly aligns sprites and makes other small modification in the vein of correcting errors. Ex. Punching revenants do not 'jump forward' when viewed from the side.
